# Overview

## Motivation

We all love to play 4X strategy games. Some of them are based on a historical context, such as the Civilisations series where the player leads a nation from a primitive tribe to a superpower, while some others are more fictional in their background settings, such as Stellaris where the player develops a space-age galactic empire from a minor state to the overlord of the galaxy.&#x20;

However, despite varying background stories, the general idea of a conventional 4X game is for the player to role-play as a nation that is the pioneer of exploration and step into what has never been traversed by the world's fore-fathers. In this sense, game progression is tied to creating the unknown of the future, and it seems that little focus is being placed to the world before the player has come into existence.

Well, in fact some games do try to draw some of the player's attention to their worlds' past. For instance, in Stellaris, the player will encounter remains of ancient galactic civilisations and gain powerful artefacts by studying their heritages. But still, these are only a side add-on to deepen the immersion and offer some nice buffs with an interesting back story.&#x20;

We want to take such experiences to the next level by developing a 4X game **whose entire storyline is completely centred around unveiling the lost legacies of a mysterious past.** In this game, the player's role is no longer a valiant voyager leading the world to progress, but a group of oblivious remnants from a forgotten world of the past, struggling to survive a harsh world and re-discovering the wisdom of their ancestors. In the process, more intriguing stories of the pre-cursors of the world are unearthed.

With such a story in mind, Project: Archaetech was born.

## The Story

You woke up from a long dream, feeling like having slept for millenia, and yet the apocalypse in that dream was so real that it almost appeared surreal. Everything around you looked so alien, but you managed to figure out that you were at the interior of some high-tech complex, and that the device from which you just got up was some kind of a hibernation chamber. You did vaguely remember that you and other people were ushered towards a certain "sanctuary" before something happened and you completely passed out, so you reckoned that this must be the "sanctuary" place where the people were heading towards.

Not before long, you heard something not far away and decided to check it out. Outside of the hibernation quarter was a long but narrow corridor. You approached the source of the sound carefully, when you realised that it was a human voice. Reluctantly, you opened a door and saw a young man of roughly your own age speaking to a restless girl, who you conjured must be his daughter. The man was instantly startled by your entrance and locked you on with a pair of defensive irises. The girl, too, was alerted, but somehow the presence of a third human being - and a stranger - alleviated her unease.

Soon, both parties realised that they were placed in a similar circumstance. You and the man agreed to search the nearby area to see if there were other people around. After parting ways, you started to check the other rooms along the corridor one by one. It did not take you long before you realised that all the rooms were exactly the same as the hibernation quarter where you woke up. The only difference was that, now with a closer look, it was clear that these were not just hibernation quarters, but small dormitories with a whole set of essential furniture. You also checked the hybernation devices in every room and found that there was a person in each one of them, but it seemed that they were all sealed up tight. At least they were still functioning, you thought, which was fortunate.

Knowing that any effort to awaken those in hibernation would be futile, you proceeded straight to the end of the corridor, where you noticed to be a control centre. The chamber was cluttered with all kinds of gadgets with fanciful looks, none of which you could squeeze out a name for from your memory. You manoeuvred through the room like an assassin master so as to not trigger anything undesirable, until you reached a platform which apparently appeared to be the central control board.

You first noticed that the control board was installed with what seemed to be a powerful super computer, which was of course dysfunctional due to low power supply. While you were sure that you meagre scientific knowlegde was far from adequate for this situation, you did understand what would happen if you pressed that big red button with a label which read "Force Stop Hibernation Procedures". The button was pressed with solid determination after a second of reluctance, and luckily you were soon relieved by the fact that you had not done anything regrettable, as you began to hear more and more human voices of all kinds of emotions.

You walked outside and talked briefly to the people you encountered about the situation you had found yourselves in, when some people suggested that everyone gather to discuss what should happen next. Agreeable, you and some others started gathering people to a large room which someone had discovered to be a warehouse. You searched the warehouse with a few others and were delighted to find that there was quite an abundant storage of food, water and some other living necessities which hopefully could last until you settle the millions of questions revolving around your head.

After distributing some food to everyone, you made a quick observation on the demographics here: there were mostly adults but also some children, with the sex ratio between males and females being roughly balanced among both adults and children. Surprisingly or oddly though, everyone was very young - at least you had not noticed anyone who appeared to be beyond 40 years of age - and you wondered why.&#x20;

Nevertheless, the people soon ascertained the fact that none of them could recollect in any reconstructible form what had happened before they all ended up here. For the time being, everyone agreed that they should continue living at whatever facility this was as the archetecture of the buildings was apparently extremely solid and safe, and looking outside from the few windows there were could quickly tell a person that no human being could survive that environment without taking deadly damage.

Yet there was always good news. Some people had found a collection of well-aged document, which could definitely reveal something about the current situation if analysed in detail, whereas a handful of youngsters were already volunteering to step outside of the facility shortly to explore around and see what they could find. It seemed that your adventure as a people in an alienated world had just begun.

## Vision

Our vision for Project: Archaetech is a 4X strategy game with heavy colony simulation elements, which focuses heavily on **exploration** and **management of economy** instead of oriented around war mechanics. We wish the game to be moderately complex in terms of its systems while still remaining fun to play, maintaining a balance between realistic game mechanics and gameplay considerations. In particular, we wish to be able to alleviate the common issue with strategy games that the game becomes much less interesting at the later stage due to growing predictability and lower risk in decision-making.
