# Welcome

This is the development log for Project: Archaetech. We are a group of game development enthusiasts from the National University of Singapore and Project: Archaetech is a self-initiated 4X game project. The game is still in its early stage of development and this development log will remain a work-in-progress throughout the course of the development. New contents will be added as the game machanics are being scripted, both serving as a documentation page and a collection of information to those who might be interested in the game's design.
